# SustainaTree
SustainaTree is an app designed to make sustainability feel tangible, honest, and personally meaningful, even in a world where large-scale emissions can make individual actions seem insignificant. Users can log everyday behaviors such as biking, thrifting, recycling, or attending sustainability-focused events like farmers markets and thrift pop-ups, with an AI-powered feature that automatically fills in event details based on a simple description. The app emphasizes immediate, visible feedback through a living tree that grows as users consistently record positive actions and declines when higher-emission behaviors dominate, reinforcing the idea that small choices still matter. While recognizing that systemic change is essential for large-scale impact, SustainaTree aims to build awareness and momentum by making collective action visible, emotional, and harder to ignore.
